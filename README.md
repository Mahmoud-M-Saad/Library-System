# Library Management System

## Project Overview

This project is a simple **Library Management System** implemented in C++. It allows interaction between users and an admin, providing the following features:

- **Admin Features**:
  - Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on books.
  - View all books and determine if it is available or not.
  - Manage library inventory.

- **User Features**:
  - Borrow books from the library.
  - Return borrowed books.
  - Search for all books by id.

### Project Scope

- The project is designed to be simple and straightforward, focusing on basic C++ programming techniques.
- It is not developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. Instead, it uses fundamental constructs like functions, loops, arrays, and basic data structures.
- Also, each model is linked to its JSON file to make all their CRUD operations on it.

## Prerequisites

To compile and run this project, you'll need:

- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC).
- A text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, or VSCode.
